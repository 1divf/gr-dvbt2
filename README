The goal of this project is to build a software-defined DVB-T2
transmitter, based on the EN 302 755 V1.3.1 Frame structure
channel coding and modulation for a second generation digital
terrestrial television broadcasting system (DVB-T2):

http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/302700_302799/302755/01.03.01_60/en_302755v010301p.pdf

The baseband framing, baseband scrambling, LDPC (low density
parity check) and BCH (Bose, Chaudhuri, Hocquenghem) blocks
are reused from gr-dvbs2 (https://github.com/drmpeg/gr-dvbs2)
which are originally from G4GUO's DATV-Express Digital Amateur
Television project. The bit interleaver, DVB-T2 modulator,
cell and time interleaver, frame mapper, frequency interleaver,
pilot generator and P1 symbol insertion blocks are all new.

The baseline implementation has been verified against the BBC
test streams available here:

ftp://ftp.kw.bbc.co.uk/t2refs/

Currently, the implementation is bit perfect with the VV008-16FFT,
VV009-4KFFT, VV010-2KFFT and VV011-1KFFT profiles.

Note: The baseline (version 1.1.1 of the DVB-T2 specification)
implementation is complete. However, the High Efficiency
baseband framing mode (HEM) has yet to be implemented, so
many BBC profiles (including the 32K/256QAM mode currently
in use in the UK) are not available.

Build instructions:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

Contributions are welcome!
